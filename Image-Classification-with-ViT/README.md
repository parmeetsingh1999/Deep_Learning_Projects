## Image Classification with Vision Transformer

This is an implementation of the Vision Transformer (ViT) model for image classification. And demonstrates it on the CIFAR-100 dataset. The ViT model applies the Transformer architecture with self-attention to sequences of image patches, without using convolution layers.
